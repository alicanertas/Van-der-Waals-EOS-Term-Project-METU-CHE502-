1) if Phyton is already installed on your computer:

-Please download and run the Python file named as 'PureSubstance_BinodalSpinodalCurves_VdW.py'
-Please see the results at the file created at the same folder (or one folder above) with Python file named as 'Binodal_Spinodal_Fugacity.txt'

2) if you rather would prefer online tools to run the code:

-Please open the Python file named as 'PureSubstance_BinodalSpinodalCurves_VdW_TerminalPrint.py' and copy its content to online Python code editors.
-Please run there and the result will be identical as reported in text file 'Binodal_Spinodal_Fugacity.txt' in the GitHub repository.
