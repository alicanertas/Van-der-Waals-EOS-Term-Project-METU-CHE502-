For Part A:
1) if Python is already installed on your computer:

-Please download and run the Python file named as 'PureSubstance_BinodalSpinodalCurves_VdW.py'
-Please see the results at the file created at the same folder (or one folder above) with Python file named as 'Binodal_Spinodal_Fugacity.txt'

2) if you rather would prefer online tools to run the code:

-Please open the Python file named as 'PureSubstance_BinodalSpinodalCurves_VdW_TerminalPrint.py' and copy its content to online Python code editors (such as https://www.online-python.com/).
-Please run there and the result will be identical as reported in text file 'Binodal_Spinodal_Fugacity.txt' in the GitHub repository. 


For Part B:
1) if Python is already installed on your computer:

-Please download and run the Python file named as 'NRTL ParameterOpt_TerminalPrint.py'
-Please download and run the Python file named as 'PhaseEquilibria_VdW_NRTL_TerminalPrint.py'
-The results will appear at the terminal of the compiler, and then the plots will appear.

2) if you rather would prefer online tools to run the code:

-Please open the Python file named as 'NRTL ParameterOpt_TerminalPrint.py' and copy its content to online Python code editors (such as https://www.w3schools.com/python/scipy/trypython.php?filename=demo_scipy_editor).
-Please open the Python file named as 'PhaseEquilibria_VdW_NRTL_TerminalPrint.py' and copy its content to online Python code editors (such as https://www.w3schools.com/python/scipy/trypython.php?filename=demo_scipy_editor).
-The results will appear at the terminal of the compiler, and then the plots will appear.
